[h1]üìã Description[/h1]
Spawner for zeds.

This mutator uses the same method of spawning zeds by timer as in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2488241348]Custom Zed Spawn Mutator[/url], but the implementation is completely new.

[h1]‚ú® Features[/h1]
[list]
[*]Spawn without increasing zed counter
[*]Spawn depends on the number of players
[*]Cyclic spawn (useful for endless mode)
[*]Separate spawn for special waves and boss waves
[*]Spawn after a certain percentage of killed zeds
[/list]

[h1]‚ùå Whitelisted?[/h1]
No. This mod is not whitelisted and will de-rank your server. Any XP earned will not be saved.

[h1]üéÆ Usage (single player)[/h1]
[olist]
[*]Subscribe to this mutator.
[*]Create a file:
[code]C:\Users\<username>\Documents\My Games\KillingFloor2\KFGame\Config\KFZedSpawner.ini[/code]
with content:
[code][ZedSpawner.ZedSpawner]
Version=0[/code]
[*]Launch KF2.
[*]Open console (~) and start any map with the mutator (this will generate the default KFZedSpawner.ini content):

[code]<kf2-server>\KFGame\Config\KFZedSpawner.ini[/code]
with content:
[code][ZedSpawner.ZedSpawner]
Version=0[/code]
[*]Add mutator to server start parameters: [code]?Mutator=ZedSpawner.Mut[/code] and start the server (this will generate the default KFZedSpawner.ini content).

[/olist]

[h1]‚öôÔ∏è Setup (KFZedSpawner.ini)[/h1]
[b]bPreloadContentServer[/b] - Enable/Disable server-side preload content.
[b]bPreloadContentClient[/b] - Enable/Disable client-side preload content.

[b]Cyclic spawn[/b]
If you don't want to write an endless spawn list for the endless mode (üòÅ) use a cyclic spawn. Set parameter [b]bCyclicalSpawn=True[/b]
After the last wave in the spawn list ends, spawn will start again from the beginning of the list.
Use the [b]SpawnTotalCycleMultiplier[/b] and [b]SingleSpawnLimitCycleMultiplier[/b] modifiers to adjust the difficulty of the following cycles.

[b]Shadow spawn[/b]
With [b]bShadowSpawn=True[/b], the zeds from the list will replace the original zeds that haven't spawned yet, so the counter of the remaining zeds won't grow. Spawning will stop when there are no unspawned zeds left.
With [b]bShadowSpawn=False[/b] zeds from the spawn list will not replace the original ones. The counter of remaining zeds will increase when spawning. Spawn will continue until the end of the wave.

[b]Smooth spawn[/b]
With [b]bSmoothSpawn=True[/b] a group of zeds will spawn gradually (1 zed per second).

[b]AliveSpawnLimit[/b]
If you have a server crash with a large number of zeds, set [b]AliveSpawnLimit[/b]. If the number of live zeds reaches the specified limit, spawning will be stopped until there are fewer zeds. At zero there is no limit.

[b]Spawn lists[/b]
Use the [b][ZedSpawner.SpawnListRegular][/b] section to set spawn on any wave.
Use the [b][ZedSpawner.SpawnListBossWaves][/b] and [b][ZedSpawner.SpawnListSpecialWaves][/b] sections to set a separate spawn for the boss wave and special waves if needed. Use [b]bStopRegularSpawn=True[/b] if you want to stop spawning from the regular list during boss waves or special waves.

[b]Spawn entry parameters[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Wave / BossClass[/b] - what wave is the spawn for. Wave number for the regular list, wave type for the special list. boss class for the boss list.
[*][b]ZedClass[/b] - the class of the zed you want to spawn (for example: ZedternalReborn.WMPawn_ZedScrake_Omega).
[*][b]RelativeStart[/b] - allows you to start spawning a zed not on a timer, but after killing the specified percentage of zeds. If set to zero, spawn will start after [b]Delay[/b] seconds from the start of the wave. Note that [b]RelativeStart[/b] does not work on bosses.
[*][b]Delay[/b] - time in seconds between spawns.
[*][b]Probability[/b] - the chance (%) of each spawn (1-100).
[*][b]SpawnCountBase[/b] - The base number of zeds to spawn, aka the number of zeds that will be spawned on the first cycle with one player. Can be adjusted by modifiers, number of players and cycle number.
[*][b]SingleSpawnLimit[/b] - maximum number of zeds for one spawn. Can be adjusted by modifiers, number of players and cycle number.
[/list]

[h1]üî¨ Spawn logic[/h1]
I really tried to describe in text how it works, but every time I got some kind of crap. Therefore, I decided to explain it a little differently and made a small calculator for this. It is interactive, you can change the parameters and see what happens. It has all the necessary explanations, so I think you will quickly figure out how the spawner works.

[list]
[*]Please try not to interfere with each other if you see that someone is already using a calculator.
[*]If some villain broke the calculator - let me know in the comments, I'll roll it back to its previous state.

[h1]üìå Notes[/h1]
[list]
[*]Mutator does not contain custom zeds. You must have the required zeds in your subscriptions to be able to spawn them.
[*]If you are using this mutator to add zeds, you should [b]not[/b] use mutators from zed packs (just having them in subscriptions is enough).
[*]If the spawner's behavior differs from what you expect, check the server logs first. ZedSpawner writes in the logs everything it does (and describes why), most likely you will find an explanation of what is happening.

[h1]‚òëÔ∏è Status: Completed[/h1]
‚úîÔ∏è The mutator works with the current version of the game (v1150) and I have implemented everything I planned.
‚õîÔ∏è Development has stopped: I no longer have the time or motivation to maintain this mod. No further updates or bug fixes are planned.
